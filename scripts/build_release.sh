# One-shot release build: plugin (universal Release), tests, macOS installer,
# library packages, and the assembled Shopify deliverable folders.

#   ./scripts/build_release.sh --stage-only <version>
#
# <library folder> is IGNORED (kept only for CLI compatibility with older
# invocations/muscle memory). The library step now calls
# scripts/build_starter.sh, which builds the Standard starter library
# directly from the commercial pack zips via the SPAStation catalog — there
# is no more `library/` folder input. Pass "-" as this argument to skip the
# library step entirely (much faster; installers + docs only) — that
# skip semantics is unchanged.
#
# --stage-only <version> re-runs ONLY the Shopify-folder staging step (4)
# against an already-built dist/installers/SPASynth-<version>-macOS.pkg —
# use this after a notarization failure is fixed (see scripts/notarize.sh)
# without rebuilding the plugin.
#
# Output layout (dist/):
#   installers/SPASynth-<v>-macOS.pkg        (signed if identities are set —
#                                             see installers/macos/build_installer.sh)
#   library/SPASynth Starter Library.zip     built by build_starter.sh from the
#                                             commercial pack zips (Pro's full
#                                             library ships separately via
#                                             SPAStation, not from here)
#   shopify/SPASynth-Standard-<v>/           ready-to-zip download folders
#   shopify/SPASynth-Pro-<v>/
#
# The Windows installer is built by CI (windows job, Inno Setup) — download
# the artifact and drop it into both shopify folders before uploading.
#
# Notarization is a separate step, scripts/notarize.sh (see that file for
# why — the notarytool keychain profile has repeatedly vanished on this
# machine). This script signs the pkg here, then calls notarize.sh.

# user's ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/. macOS's AudioComponent lookup prefers the
# user domain over the system domain (/Library, where the signed release
# installs), so a leftover dev copy silently shadows every subsequent signed
# install in any DAW, however recent or correctly signed it is. This bit us
# repeatedly (1.0.4, 1.0.8) whenever a dev copy from earlier verification work
# wasn't manually cleared before staging a release. Unconditional and
# automatic here so it can never again depend on remembering a manual step.
