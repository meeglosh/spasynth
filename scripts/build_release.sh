# One-shot release build: plugin (universal Release), tests, macOS installer,
# library packages, and the assembled Shopify deliverable folders.

# <library folder> defaults to ./library (the build_library.sh output). Pass
# "-" to skip library packaging (much faster; installers + docs only).

# Output layout (dist/):
#   installers/SPASynth-<v>-macOS.pkg        (signed if identities are set —
#                                             see installers/macos/build_installer.sh)
#   library/packs/<Pack>.zip                 88 add-on packs
#   library/SPASynth Starter Library.zip
#   shopify/SPASynth-Standard-<v>/           ready-to-zip download folders
#   shopify/SPASynth-Pro-<v>/
#
# The Windows installer is built by CI (windows job, Inno Setup) — download
# the artifact and drop it into both shopify folders before uploading.
