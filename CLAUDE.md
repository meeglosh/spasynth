# SPASynth — project state & working guide

Commercial hybrid soft synth from **Silverplatter Audio**, primarily a
boutique sound-effects library company (SPASynth is our synth product).
Customer-facing materials speak in the company's own first-person voice
("we"/"our"/"Silverplatter Audio") and never name individuals. Sold via
Shopify. JUCE 8.0.14 (submodule `libs/JUCE`), C++20, CMake + Ninja.
Formats: AU/VST3/Standalone (macOS universal), VST3/Standalone (Windows x64).
AAX deliberately out for v1. Original spec: `spasynth-claude-code-brief.md`
(the project was renamed Arsenal → SPASynth; the repo folder is still
`arsenal`, plugin code `SpSy`, manufacturer `SpAu`).

## Current state (2026-07-21): v1.0.3 — merged to `main`, built + signed, in smoke testing

v1.0.3 is **merged to `main`** (CMake version 1.0.3; the release merge is
`2559c2f`). All 11 planned features plus the post-merge smoke-test refinements
below are implemented, unit-tested (`SPASynthTests` ALL PASS), and the full
plugin validates (`auval` PASS, `pluginval` strictness-8 SUCCESS incl. param
fuzz). The signed + notarized macOS pkg and the CI-built Windows exe are in
`dist/installers/` and both `dist/shopify/SPASynth-{Standard,Pro}-1.0.3/`
folders (byte-identical across locations; library zips APFS-cloned from 1.0.2,
which is unchanged). **NOT yet distributed** — still 1.0.3, keep iterating on it
(don't bump) until it goes out. The 11 base features, one commit each:

1. Panic button (`b31f2ab`) — stop all sound + clear stuck/latched notes.
2. Standalone tempo (`91274c9`) — internal BPM + tap + external MIDI clock.
3. FX reorder foundation (`f1de48d`) — drag tabs -> chain order (packed atomic).
4. Mod tab (`4d6a9b3`) — Phaser/Flanger, reorderable.
5. Trem/Vib tab (`21b2548`) — independent tremolo + vibrato, reorderable.
6. Limiter/Maximizer (`aadd140`) — reorderable, defaults last, optional lookahead.
7. Convolve (`f4e12a5`) — library SFX / user WAV as impulse (juce::dsp::Convolution).
8. FDN reverb (`748d2c3`) — 4-line FDN, Hall/Plate/Chamber/Room/Spring; ALSO
   fixed a real reorder desync bug (bar moveTab moved only buttons, not the
   TabbedComponent content array -> selecting a tab showed the wrong panel).
9. Parametric EQ — DSP core (`b724b0b`, 8-band hand-rolled RBJ biquads, RT-safe,
   character modes) + interactive Pro-Q editor (`8918ebd`, draggable nodes,
   wheel=Q, double-click add/remove, live FFT analyzer via a Telemetry scope ring).
10. Voice modes (`06070f0`) — Poly/Mono/Duo/Paraphonic/Unison in a rewritten
    `GlideSynthesiser` (note-stack + priority; unison via direct startVoice with
    per-voice detune/pan; paraphonic = shared amp env rendered by the processor,
    per-voice `paraSawGate` latch). Header VOICE call-out. Also fixed a -Wswitch
    gap in the randomizer lock-group map (the four new FX sections).
11. Oversampling (`3e0fa5f`) — whole-synth Off/2x/4x/8x. `processBlock`'s engine
    section factored into `renderEngine()`; runs on the host buffer or an
    oversampled block (juce::dsp::Oversampling IIR polyphase), MIDI scaled to the
    engine domain, tempo/CC layer stays host-domain. Factor swap on the message
    thread under `getCallbackLock()` (purge timer now 150 ms). Settings-menu item.

New invariants worth remembering: **FXChain::Module + numModules(9) + the
default-order array + the fxOrder packed atomic are load-bearing** (order
serialized per preset). **ParametricEQ band choice orders (types) and the
VoiceMode/NotePriority/reverb-mode/EQ-character choice orders are append-only.**
The **Telemetry scope ring** (post-master, 2048 pow2) feeds the EQ analyzer.
Paraphonic gate lags one block by design. Voice-mode + oversampling params live
in `Section::global`; the EQ bands are generated via `id::eqBand(band, key)`.

**Post-merge smoke-test refinements (all on `main`, each rebuilt + re-signed):**
- FX tab grip fix (`465afcd`) — grips were drawn as a fixed left overlay while
  the text was centred; after a drag reorder the bar re-laid-out tight and the
  text slid onto the grips. Reserve grip width in `getTabButtonBestWidth` + the
  text draw for DraggableTabButton (SPASynthLookAndFeel).
- Glide layout (`8f0da9d`) — GLIDE knob now sits left of the mode dropdown.
- EQ interactions (`50bbce1`,`36897de`) — double-click empty to add a band /
  double-click a node to remove (single click just selects); Cmd/Ctrl-drag a
  node vertically for Q (anchored, Pro-Q style) in addition to the wheel; a
  selected-node ring + a freq/gain/Q readout + an on-panel hint and tooltip.
- Limiter scrolling meter (`4f1956e`) — replaced the static curve with a Pro-L-
  style scrolling output waveform + amber gain-reduction from the top + live GR
  readout, fed by a new lock-free `Telemetry` limiter ring (limOut/limGrDb, one
  frame per block; master level w/ 0 GR when off). Bigger display, compact strip.
- Convolve library dropdown (`7c27640`) — a "From library..." button browses
  packs then samples (one folder scanned at a time, like the osc quick-swap).
- Convolve waveform + shaping (`db318f6`) — pre-delay (wet gap), decay (exp IR
  fade), damping (IR HF roll-off) added; the raw IR is kept and RESHAPED (not
  re-read) on the 150 ms timer, reloaded via `loadImpulseResponse(buffer,...)`,
  and re-applied after `prepare` so it survives sr/oversampling changes. New
  `ConvolveDisplay` draws the shaped-IR envelope with the pre-delay gap.
- FX-order randomize + limiter auto-gain (`9356c43`) — RANDOMIZE ALL shuffles
  the chain order (gated by the FX lock group), but the limiter keeps its slot;
  the editor re-applies the tab order on the change broadcast (`refreshAll` ->
  `fxTabs.applyOrder`). Limiter auto-gain toggle = output makeup of `1/drive`
  (transparent peak control; off by default).
- Changelog kept current for all of the above (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, house style).

**Signing/CI are ready on this machine:** the Developer ID Application +
Installer certs are in the login keychain and the `SPASYNTH_NOTARY` notary
profile works, so the signed+notarized macOS build runs unattended. The rebuild
loop each time a fix lands: `export SPASYNTH_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID
Application: Kenzora Games (7K9WY5T49S)"`, `SPASYNTH_INSTALLER_IDENTITY=
"Developer ID Installer: Kenzora Games (7K9WY5T49S)"`, `SPASYNTH_NOTARIZE_PROFILE
="SPASYNTH_NOTARY"`, then `./scripts/build_release.sh -` (skip library repackage
— unchanged); push `main` to trigger Windows CI (Windows-only-on-push, no 10x
macOS); `gh run download <id> -n spasynth-installer-Windows`; copy the pkg+exe
into the two shopify folders; verify one-hash byte-identity + `minos 11.0` +
`spctl` accepted. (Mike's PAT expired mid-session once — `gh auth login` fixes
it; the PAT needs `repo` + `workflow` scopes, Actions:read is enough.)

**Remaining for launch (Mike's manual steps):**
1. **Re-private the GitHub repo** — it was made public for the Windows CI builds.
2. **Install + smoke-test the macOS pkg** (`sudo installer -pkg … -target /`; the
   agent can't sudo). Exercise the new surfaces: EQ node editor, FX reorder +
   RANDOMIZE reshuffle, voice modes, oversampling, the limiter meter + auto-gain,
   the Convolve waveform/shaping + library browser.
3. **Windows real-DAW smoke test** — the one untested surface.
4. **Shopify build-out** per `docs/shopify-setup-guide.md`; the 1.0.3 folders are
   ready to attach.
5. Marketing site / announcement when ready.

## Current state (2026-07-20): v1.0.2 — first build to the testing team

v1.0.2 is the build Mike is sending to the partner testers (Paul, Phil) — the
first time it leaves his machine. Signed + notarized (macOS), freshly CI-built
(Windows). One clean set in `dist/installers/` and the
`dist/shopify/SPASynth-{Standard,Pro,Upgrade}-1.0.2/` folders (byte-identical
across locations). Team changelog: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`. Version stays **1.0.2**
(never distributed before); bump to 1.0.3+ for any change after this goes out.

**1.0.2 changes (from the partner testing round):**
- **CRITICAL — macOS deployment target (load-bearing).** Builds had no
  `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, so binaries inherited the build machine's OS
  (macOS 26, `minos 26`); dyld refused to launch the standalone on anything
  older (plugins still loaded — hosts dlopen them without an
  LSMinimumSystemVersion check). Pinned to **11.0** before `project()` with
  FORCE (stale caches held an empty value). Never remove this. Verify:
  `otool -l <bin> | grep -A2 LC_BUILD_VERSION` → `minos 11.0`.
- **Arp swing fix.** `firstStep` was computed from the un-swung beat, so a swung
  (odd) step whose delay crossed an audio-buffer boundary was dropped (every odd
  step of a 1/16 arp). Start the scan one step early, guarded against
  double-fire (`Arpeggiator.cpp`) + `reverbMixTest`-style regression in the arp
  test.
- **Settings menu.** Top-left logo (`SettingsButton` overlay over the painted
  logo) opens a PopupMenu: Set Library Folder, Rescan, Accent Colors, Show
  Keyboard, Clear All MIDI Learn. Works in plugin AND standalone. Answers Phil's
  "no settings menu in Live" — the standalone's JUCE "Options" button is
  audio-DEVICE settings, which cannot exist in a plugin (the host owns the audio
  device + MIDI routing), so this is the host-correct equivalent.
- **On-screen keyboard.** `juce::MidiKeyboardComponent` bottom strip, toggled
  from the settings menu or the bottom-right `KeyboardButton` (piano icon, lit
  in the accent colour when shown, kept clear of the window resize grip). Mouse
  + computer-QWERTY playing (JUCE maps the keys by default). Processor owns a
  `juce::MidiKeyboardState`; `processBlock` merges its notes via
  `keyboardState.processNextMidiBuffer(...)` (brief lock — the standard JUCE
  on-screen-keyboard idiom, accepted here). Persists in the APVTS property
  `uiKeyboardVisible`. The strip adds `metrics::keyboardStripHeight` to the
  content base height so the module grid is unchanged; the shell re-fixes the
  window aspect ratio on toggle (`getContentBaseHeight`, `keyboardToggled`,
  `configureConstrainer` in `SPASynthEditor.cpp`).
- **Reverb MIX fix.** Was `wetLevel=mix, dryLevel=1-0.4*mix` — the dry never
  dropped below ~60% (never full wet), and juce::Reverb scales dryLevel by 2x
  internally so mix=0 was ~+6 dB, not transparent. Now an equal-power crossfade:
  `wetLevel=sin(theta), dryLevel=0.5*cos(theta)`, theta = `mix*halfPi` → unity
  dry at 0, pure reverb at 1. This changes how reverb-heavy factory presets
  sound (quieter, more balanced). `FXChain::processReverb` + `reverbMixTest`.
- UI polish: master meter padded off the right edge; keyboard toggle button.

**CI change (`.github/workflows/build.yml`).** Repo went private mid-session;
private repos meter Actions minutes and **macOS runners bill at 10x**, so one
~2h universal run drained the monthly quota and every push then failed instantly
(4s, no steps). CI's macOS artifact was unsigned/unused (we build+sign+notarize
macOS locally), so: **Windows builds on every push** (only platform we cannot
build locally); **macOS is `workflow_dispatch` only**. Until the quota resets or
a spending limit is set, a private repo cannot build Windows — the session
workaround was to make the repo **temporarily public**, push (Windows-only on
push = no 10x macOS), `gh run download ... -n spasynth-installer-Windows`, then
re-private. PAT has Actions:read (Mike enabled it) but not Actions:write (cannot
`gh run rerun`; trigger with an empty commit push instead).

**Signing/notary gotcha.** The `SPASYNTH_NOTARY` keychain profile vanished
mid-session (notarize failed "No Keychain password item found for profile") with
the keychain unlocked. Mike recreated it: `xcrun notarytool store-credentials
SPASYNTH_NOTARY --apple-id <id> --team-id 7K9WY5T49S` (prompts for the
app-specific password, kept local). If notarize fails this way the signed pkg
does NOT need rebuilding — just `xcrun notarytool submit <pkg>
--keychain-profile SPASYNTH_NOTARY --wait` then `xcrun stapler staple <pkg>`.

**Open (not launch blockers):**
- **External-monitor drag (Paul).** Standalone window will not drag from a
  Retina laptop screen onto an external monitor (mixed-DPI). Root cause:
  fixed-aspect window + the points-per-pixel change at the display seam; JUCE
  re-evaluates size against the aspect ratio and snaps it back. Not reproducible
  on Mike's matched-DPI setup; risky to fix blind (could break resizing for
  everyone); works fine as a plugin in a DAW. Documented as a known limitation
  in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; workarounds: make the external the main display, or use
  the plugin. Revisit post-launch on a real mixed-DPI rig if customers hit it.
- **RX 9 "Failed to load" (Phil).** Not a bug: RX 9 is an effects host and
  cannot host an instrument (SPASynth is a synth; Zebra2 shows the same in RX).
  The VST3 passes pluginval strictness 8 and loads in Logic/Live. Test in an
  instrument host.

## Where the project stands (2026-07-11)

**v1.0.0 — feature-complete, packaged, in macOS smoke testing.** All 10 brief
checkpoints are done, plus post-brief features: dual filters
(series/parallel), UAD-style preset browser drawer, glide (Off/Always/Legato),
arp probability controls (chance/stutter/jump/humanize), user-tintable accent
colors (light mode removed), license.txt ownership stamp in the footer,
2-decimal value readouts, and the full packaging pipeline.

**Smoke testing found + fixed four shipping bugs (all committed/pushed):**
1. `33abff0` — installer only laid down the Standalone; AU/VST3 silently
   didn't install. Cause: all three component pkgs shared one identifier
   (`com.silverplatteraudio.spasynth`, derived from the common
   CFBundleIdentifier). Fix: explicit unique `--identifier` + `--version` per
   `pkgbuild --component` (`installers/macos/build_installer.sh`).
2. `33abff0` — standalone had no app icon. Fix: `assets/branding/app_icon.svg`
   (+ `make_app_icon.sh` → `app_icon.png`) wired as `ICON_BIG` in
   `juce_add_plugin`; JUCE emits the `.icns`/`.ico`.
3. `9b15cd2` — standalone hard-crashed (SIGABRT via macOS TCC) on the
   Bluetooth MIDI menu. Cause: no `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` in
   Info.plist. Fix: `BLUETOOTH_PERMISSION_ENABLED/_TEXT` +
   `MICROPHONE_PERMISSION_ENABLED/_TEXT` in `juce_add_plugin` (mic added
   pre-emptively — audio input would TCC-crash the same way).
4. The AU *installed then vanished* on upgrade installs (receipt written,
   bundle gone from `/Library/...`; Logic never saw it). Root cause: all
   three bundles shared one CFBundleIdentifier, and PackageKit keys its
   payload "atomic shove" bookkeeping on the bundle id — three same-id
   payloads in one install collide and the AU gets trashed right after
   landing (`/var/log/install.log` showed "Parent bundle … will be
   atomically shoved" ×3 with one id; the fixed pkg logs three distinct
   ids). Fix: per-format CFBundleIdentifier patched into the JUCE-generated
   plists at configure time (CMakeLists.txt — AU = `…spasynth.au`, VST3 =
   `…spasynth.vst3`, standalone keeps the base id since it owns the TCC
   grants), plus `BundleIsRelocatable=false` component plists in
   `build_installer.sh`. Same scheme Arturia/Soundtoys/Softube ship. Host
   compat unaffected (AU identity = aumu/SpSy/SpAu; VST3 = class UUID).

**macOS smoke test now PASSES end-to-end**: the reinstalled pkg laid down
all three formats and they stayed put; icon + Bluetooth prompt OK; auval +
pluginval pass on the installed copies; SPASynth loads and plays in Logic.
The pkg is still UNSIGNED, so first launch needs right-click → Open.

Follow-up polish from the same smoke-test day (all committed/pushed; Logic
behaviour confirmed by Mike where noted):
- `2251488` — library discovery falls back to any WAV-holding folder inside
  a "Silverplatter Audio" dir when no folder named "SPASynth Library"
  exists. (Mike's "samples not loading" was the dev symlink still pointing
  at ~/arsenal after the repo folder rename — repointed.)
- `91bd70d` — macOS Tahoe + Logic's AUHostingService opens the editor with
  a stale hit-test region (top strip dead until a knob moves; Apple bug,
  hits non-JUCE plugins too, REAPER/standalone immune). Workaround: 1px
  resize nudge + repaint after the editor first shows (AU/macOS only,
  `parentHierarchyChanged`). Confirmed fixed in Logic.
- `f1d18c6` — loading state while slot content loads: sweep bar + dimmed
  stale waveform + "loading..." header label; per-slot atomic pendingLoads
  counters on the processor; third snapshot `spasynth-loading.png`.
- `f7aee02` — both accents default to Silverplatter teal #51D0BF (the old
  orange/cyan pair read too close to MiniFreak); LINK defaults on and the
  picker's RESET re-links.
- `ff537aa` — brand wordmark centred on true glyph ink via path bounds
  (GlyphArrangement's box is advance-based; tracked text sat 5.5px left).
- `826cf82` — coarse tune excluded from RANDOMIZE ALL (semitone jumps break
  the song key; fine detune still rolls; same pattern as rootNote).

Dev-machine notes from the bug-4 session:
- Both build trees had stale CMake caches from the `~/arsenal` →
  `~/spasynth` folder rename; both were reconfigured from scratch.
- installd (as root) had earlier "relocated" an app payload INTO the build
  tree — a root-owned `build-release/SPASynth_artefacts/Release/Standalone/
  SPASynth.app.root-junk` remains; Mike can `sudo rm -rf` it whenever.
- Logic caches per-version validation verdicts: after replacing a
  same-version AU, use Plug-in Manager → Reset & Rescan Selection, then
  RESTART Logic (the plugin menu is built at launch).
- Dev builds copy Debug plugins into ~/Library, which shadow the installed
  /Library release copies in Logic — clear them (`rm -rf ~/Library/Audio/
  Plug-Ins/{Components/SPASynth.component,VST3/SPASynth.vst3}`) whenever
  Mike is smoke-testing the installed release.
- GitHub repo renamed to `meeglosh/spasynth` (remote updated).

**macOS signing/notarization: DONE (2026-07-17).** Kenzora Games Developer
ID (team `7K9WY5T49S`); certs imported to login keychain (had to use
`security import` via CLI — double-click threw -25294 on this macOS), keys
authorized for the signing tools with `security set-key-partition-list`
(else codesign stalls on a GUI prompt), notary creds stored as keychain
profile `SPASYNTH_NOTARY` (app-specific password). The shipping pkg
`dist/installers/SPASynth-1.0.0-macOS.pkg` is signed + notarized + stapled
(spctl: "Notarized Developer ID / accepted") and copied into both
`dist/shopify/` folders. To re-sign a future build:
`export SPASYNTH_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Kenzora Games (7K9WY5T49S)"`,
`SPASYNTH_INSTALLER_IDENTITY="Developer ID Installer: Kenzora Games (7K9WY5T49S)"`,
`SPASYNTH_NOTARIZE_PROFILE="SPASYNTH_NOTARY"`, then `./scripts/build_release.sh`.

**Windows installer: BUILT + STAGED (2026-07-17).** CI had a latent bug —
the Inno `/O` output path used `..\..\dist\installers` (correct base for
Source paths, which are .iss-relative, but `/O` is CWD-relative), so the
`.exe` landed two levels above the workspace and the artifact upload found
nothing on every prior run. Fixed in `e719088` (absolute
`%GITHUB_WORKSPACE%` path). `SPASynth-1.0.0-Windows.exe` (unsigned by
decision) is now in `dist/installers/` and both `dist/shopify/` folders.
Both SKU folders are complete: signed pkg + exe + library zips + 3 docs
(Standard 3.0 GB, Pro 32 GB; every Pro part < 5 GB Shopify cap).

**Post-prep UI polish (all committed, verified in Logic, in the shipping
build `9dcae8e`):** flat modern knobs (thin ring + accent arc + position
dot, replacing the skeuomorphic disc; `664e2be`); padlock glyph on locked
section buttons; animated granular playback — the waveform shows the live
grain cloud (per-slot `Telemetry::GrainViz`, published each mod chunk;
`7524a4c`); in-pack sample quick-swap — click the osc sample name for a
dropdown of the whole pack (`getPackSiblings` + latest-wins load serial;
`bd149b0`); solid triangle preset-nav carets (`5b7f223`); and the WILD knob
ring heats accent → red with amount (HSV lerp; `9dcae8e`). The signed +
notarized macOS pkg and the fresh Windows exe in both `dist/shopify/`
folders include all of it (rebuilt 2026-07-17).

**Product listings written** to `docs/shopify-listings.md` (descriptions,
SEO fields, card blurbs, FAQ, pricing, per-SKU attachment lists; no em
dashes). Sound count corrected to 11,474 everywhere (verified WAV count;
spasynth.com still says 11,401 and needs updating outside the repo).

**Official pricing (USD):** Standard $99 intro / $149 reg; Pro $499 sale /
$899 reg (the $899 = the Everything Bundle price); Upgrade = the difference,
$400 intro ($499−$99) / $750 reg ($899−$149). Set Shopify Price = intro,
Compare-at = reg. Intro-period length TBD. (Earlier $702/$1264 figures were
CAD by mistake; corrected to USD 2026-07-18 across all docs.)

**Everything that can be built/staged is DONE.** Signed+notarized macOS pkg
and fresh Windows exe (both from `9dcae8e`) are in `dist/installers/` and,
with the library zips + docs, in both `dist/shopify/SPASynth-{Standard,Pro}
-1.0.0/` folders — verified byte-identical across locations. The full launch
copy kit is written and committed: `docs/shopify-listings.md` (descriptions,
SEO, blurbs, FAQ, pricing, per-SKU attachment lists), `docs/launch-email.md`
(HTML + plain-text), `docs/social-posts.md` (X + Instagram),
`docs/marketing-brief.md` (landing-page source), `docs/spasynth-marketing.png`
(retina hero). All customer copy: "we"/Silverplatter Audio voice, no
individual names, no em dashes, 11,474 sound count.

**Pro library delivery = Cloudflare R2 (done 2026-07-18).** The 37 GB Pro
library exceeds Shopify's per-product cap, so the 11 parts live on R2 (bucket
`spasynth`, account `25de31a7…`) with clean names
`SPASynth-Pro-Library-Part-01..11.zip` under `pro-library/`, public via the
custom domain **downloads.spasynth.com** (spasynth.com DNS moved GoDaddy →
Cloudflare; site still on GitHub Pages, grey-cloud A records; no email on the
domain). Verified: `curl` HEAD 200 + correct size + valid ZIP. Delivered to
buyers via a small links file `dist/shopify/SPASynth Pro Library - Download
Links.txt`. Uploads done with `rclone` (remote `r2`, `no_check_bucket=true`;
the R2 API token is bucket-scoped so ListBuckets/CreateBucket 403 is normal —
use bucket-direct ops). R2 has no egress fees, so downloads are ~free.

**Remaining for launch (Mike's manual steps, nothing to code):**
1. **Windows real-DAW smoke test** — the one untested surface. Load the VST3
   in Reaper/Live/Cubase, confirm the library auto-discovers and a preset
   plays. Windows unsigned → "More info → Run anyway" past SmartScreen.
2. **Shopify build-out** — full plain-English click-by-click walkthrough is
   saved to `docs/shopify-setup-guide.md` (Mike is non-technical on the ops
   side; hand-hold). Standard uploads its 3 GB starter library directly; Pro
   and Upgrade deliver the big library via the R2 links file (do NOT upload the
   32 GB to Shopify). Attach lists per SKU are in `docs/shopify-listings.md`
   and the guide. Set Price=intro, Compare-at=regular; uncheck "physical
   product"; test-purchase; activate.
3. **Free "Everything Bundle" product (Part 6 of the guide)** — decision of
   record: bundle owners get SPASynth free. Make an installer-only product
   (pkg+exe+docs, no library), price 0, kept off the public storefront, shared
   via direct link or a 100%-off code. TODO: pick the mechanism + notify list.
4. **Marketing site update** — spasynth.com still says 11,401 and predates
   the "we"/company voice + the quick-swap feature. Use the prompt drafted
   in-session (Claude Code in the site repo): fix count to 11,474, first-
   person company voice (no names), boutique-SFX-company positioning + the
   mission statement, add in-pack quick-swap to feature lists, verify pricing.
5. **Announce** — send `docs/launch-email.md`, post `docs/social-posts.md`.
6. **Add-on pack products (later)** — one per pack from `dist/library/packs/`.

**Open verification (before publishing the existing-library FAQ):** confirm
the shipping SFX-library downloads are laid out as pack-folder-per-library
containing WAVs (so "just point SPASynth at your existing folders via SET
LIBRARY" holds). SPASynth reads ONE library root and treats its immediate
subfolders as packs; factory presets regenerate from whatever files are found
(portable `$LIB$/pack/file`), and the loader resamples, so customers' 24/96
originals work as-is with no re-download or conversion. Covered by the three
new FAQ entries in `docs/shopify-listings.md`.

Business decisions of record: two SKUs differentiated by **content only**
(one binary, no gating). Standard = full synth + 440-sound starter library;
Pro = all 88 packs / 11,474 WAVs / 37 GB at 24/48 (24/96 originals archived
by Mike). **No DRM ever** — no serials, no activation (Mike re-confirmed
after considering a serial system; the license.txt footer stamp is the
agreed alternative). Upgrade path is handled entirely in Shopify.
**Everything Bundle owners get SPASynth free** (part of their lifetime
updates; Mike's call) — deliver the installer only, they point at their
existing bundle via SET LIBRARY. **Existing SFX-library customers reuse
their own folders** (no separate SPASynth folder, no re-download). Company
identity: **Silverplatter Audio is primarily a boutique sound-effects
library company**; SPASynth is our synth product. All customer-facing copy
is first-person company voice ("we"/"our"), never names individuals, and
uses no em dashes; sound count is 11,474.

## The verification ritual (do this for every change)

1. `cmake --build build --target SPASynthTests` then run
   `build/SPASynthTests_artefacts/Debug/SPASynthTests` → expect `ALL PASS`
   (140+ assertions). Fix every new compiler warning — one caught a real
   Filter-2 lock bug.
2. UI changes: render snapshots and **actually look at them**:
   `SPASynthTests --snapshot <dir>` writes `spasynth-dark.png` (preset
   browser open, FILTER 2 + DELAY fronted) and `spasynth-accent.png`
   (violet/lime re-tint). Note: renders pick up the *user's saved accent
   colors* from machine settings; the committed `docs/*.png` are the visual
   regression record — refresh them from a defaults run.
3. `cmake --build build --target SPASynth_AU SPASynth_VST3` then
   `auval -v aumu SpSy SpAu` and
   `pluginval --strictness-level 8 --validate ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/SPASynth.vst3`.
4. Commit + push at every completed feature (Mike expects this cadence).

Dev build dir is `build/` (Ninja, Debug, plugins copied to user plugin
folders). Release: `./scripts/build_release.sh` (uses `build-release/`,
universal, runs tests, builds pkg, packages library, assembles
`dist/shopify/`; pass `-` to skip the slow library packaging). Ignore stale
clangd/IDE diagnostics ("juce not found" etc.) — the build is the arbiter.

## Load-bearing invariants (break these = break users' sessions)

- **`source/params/ParameterRegistry.*` is the single source of truth** for
  every parameter (range/default/section/mod-dest flag/RandomSpec/choices).
  Add params there, never ad hoc. New params are keyed by ID so placement is
  free, EXCEPT:
  - **ModSource enum is append-only** (serialized in matrix route choices).
  - **Mod-destination order is append-only**: dense dest indices are
    serialized; new destination params must be appended AFTER all existing
    dests in registry order (capacity `maxModDests = 96`).
  - Choice-parameter orders (filter types, osc modes, arp modes, LFO shapes,
    divisions, glide modes) are load-bearing and append-only.
- **Real-time safety**: no allocation/locks/IO on the audio thread.
  Content loads on background threads → atomic live pointers → timer-deferred
  retirement (processor). Fixed-capacity everything in voices/arp
  (`Arpeggiator` pending-ratchet queue, preallocated scratch MidiBuffer).
- **Per-voice modulation at 64-sample chunks** in normalized space; chaos and
  granular followers use one-chunk-latency feedback. `SharedState` is written
  once per block by the processor; voices only read (glide origin/key-count
  is the exception — written by `GlideSynthesiser` note hooks in event order).
- **UI reads all colors/fonts/metrics from `source/ui/Theme.h` tokens at
  paint time.** No light theme; accents are user preferences (see picker).
  Value formatting is set at parameter construction (adaptive ≤2 decimals).
- **Machine settings** (library root, favorites, accent colors + link,
  MIDI-learn map is session-state not settings) go through the single
  `PropertiesFile` singleton in `source/library/Library.cpp` — never create
  another PropertiesFile (that pattern caused the theme-reset bug).
- **Portable paths**: sample/wavetable refs inside presets/sessions are
  `$LIB$/...` relative to the library root.
- Presets: `.spasynth` XML; factory presets are generated per pack
  (Keys/Texture/Pulse from smallest/middle/largest WAV — the starter library
  intentionally includes exactly those files so Standard presets all load).
- MIDI-Learn maps ride host sessions but are **excluded from presets**.

## Map

- `source/SPASynthProcessor.*` — APVTS, raw-pointer caches (`Raw` struct),
  `updateSharedState`, `buildStateTree/restoreStateTree`, randomizeAll,
  library refresh, content storage.
- `source/dsp/` — `SPASynthVoice` (7 engines/slot, dual filters, glide,
  chaos), `Arpeggiator` (modes + probability), `FXChain`, `Telemetry`
  (lock-free audio→UI), loaders.
- `source/params/` — registry + `Randomizer` (lock groups, wildness).
- `source/library/` — settings singleton, auto-discovery
  (`/Users/Shared/Silverplatter Audio/SPASynth Library` etc.), PresetManager,
  license stamp (`getLicenseLine`).
- `source/ui/` — `Theme.h` tokens, LookAndFeel, `SPASynthEditor`
  (ContentComponent + fixed-aspect scaling shell + accent picker),
  `PresetBrowser` drawer, `ModulePanels`, `Displays` (telemetry scopes),
  `Controls.h` (Knob/Choice/Toggle with paramID props for MIDI Learn).
- `tests/SPASynthTests.cpp` — the whole suite + `--snapshot` renderer.
- `scripts/` — `build_library.sh` (zips→24/48 packs), `package_library.sh`
  (pack zips + starter + Pro volumes; APFS-clone staging, idempotent),
  `build_release.sh` (one-shot release + Shopify folders).
- `installers/` — macOS pkg builder (unique per-component ids + signing
  hooks), Windows Inno `.iss`.
- `packaging/` — customer docs (README/QUICKSTART/EULA),
  `license-template.txt` (per-order ownership stamp).
- `assets/branding/` — logo SVGs + `app_icon.svg`/`app_icon.png` (standalone
  icon, wired via `ICON_BIG`); regen the PNG with `make_app_icon.sh`.
- Local-only (gitignored): `library/` (88 built packs, symlinked to
  `/Users/Shared/...`), `Silverplatter Audio packs/` (raw zips),
  `dist/`, `build*/`. A starter-library copy for Standard-experience testing
  lives at `/Users/Shared/Silverplatter Audio/SPASynth Starter Library`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- Comment style: explain constraints/why, sparingly; match existing density.
- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): macOS universal + Windows x64 + both
  unsigned installers as artifacts. macOS job is slow (~1 h JUCE build).
- GitHub remote: `https://github.com/meeglosh/SPASynth.git`. Mike's PAT has
  repo+workflow scopes but not admin.
- Snapshot tests front tabs/drawer via `dynamic_cast` walks; keep component
  types discoverable if refactoring.
- `juce_add_binary_data` asset list: the white square logo filename really is
  `SPAudio_logo_sqaure_white.svg` (upstream typo, kept).
- Old "Arsenal"-named DAW sessions predate the rename and won't reconnect.
- Release rebuilds: never hand-`rm` subdirs inside
  `build-release/SPASynth_artefacts/` — Ninja relinks the binary but skips the
  bundle-assembly steps (Info.plist, VST3 manifest), leaving half-built
  bundles that `pkgbuild` rejects. To force a clean rebuild, delete the whole
  `SPASynth_artefacts/` dir (the compiled objects live in
  `build-release/CMakeFiles/`, so this re-archives + relinks + reassembles in
  ~40s with no source recompile).
- Installing the pkg needs admin (`sudo installer -pkg … -target /`); the
  agent shell can't sudo, so the actual install is always Mike's step.
