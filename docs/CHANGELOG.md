# SPASynth changelog

## 1.0.15

A large round of features and fixes from our testers' playtest sessions.

- Analog oscillators gain a SUB knob: a square wave one octave below the
  main waveform, phase-locked so it never drifts, just like the classic
  sub-oscillator slider on a vintage analog synth.
- With LOOP on, sample oscillators gain a SYNC option that turns the loop
  into a beat-locked, tempo-matched part of your project. SYNC snaps the
  loop's start and end to the sample's own beat grid, stretches it to your
  project's tempo while keeping its pitch (using the sample's own detected
  tempo, which you can edit if we guessed wrong), and follows your project's
  tempo and time signature, locking to the transport while it plays, like a
  clip launcher: press a key and the loop joins in on the beat, right where
  the transport currently is. The readout shows the sample's own tempo when
  SYNC is off (e.g. "Sample ~137 BPM · 2 bars") and, once SYNC is on, the
  stretch and your project's time signature too ("137 -> 120 BPM · 2 bars ·
  4/4"). Turning LOOP off hides SYNC, since it's a loop feature.
- A time signature setting is available for the standalone's tempo bar and,
  for hosts that don't tell us their own signature, from the settings menu
  as well, so synced sample loops always land on the right beat.
- You can now zoom and pan the oscillator waveform display, which makes it
  much easier to work with long samples. Scroll or pinch to zoom in and out
  around your cursor, drag to pan once zoomed, and double-click to snap back
  to the whole file. Loop points and other markers stay lined up with the
  waveform no matter how far in you zoom.
- Knobs that are being modulated now show it live, with a moving indicator
  and a shaded range on the ring, while the knob itself keeps your base
  setting.
- EQ bands can now be switched between Bell, Low Shelf, High Shelf, Low Cut,
  High Cut, Notch, Band Pass and Tilt Shelf by right-clicking a node in the
  EQ display. Low Cut and High Cut bands also get a slope choice from 6 to
  48 dB per octave, for a real low-cut or high-pass instead of a single gentle
  filter. Double-clicking near the left or right edge of the EQ display now
  drops in a low cut or high cut in one gesture.
- Pulse factory presets now combine the pack's own sound with a real synth
  oscillator (wavetable, analog or FM), with the sample's own dynamics,
  pitch or envelope driving that synth layer in a different way for each of
  the six variants (its level, its pitch, the shared filter, a wavetable's
  scan position, or an FM amount). Every Pulse preset is now a genuine mix
  rather than sample-only. Every wavetable layer across all our factory
  presets now picks one of our built-in wavetable shapes to suit its
  character (Supersaw, Unison Spread, PWM or Bells, among others) instead of
  defaulting to a plain basic shape, and every preset's reverb has been
  re-voiced for our newer reverb engine, choosing the reverb character (Room,
  Plate, Chamber, Hall or Spring) and amount that best suits each sound.
- Fixed a real cause of totally silent factory presets against long,
  real-world sound-effects files: a held note's sample loop is now a short,
  guaranteed-audible window near the start of the file rather than looping
  the file's full length, so a long recording's own natural decay, or a
  quiet stretch partway through, can no longer leave a held note silent for
  the rest of its hold; granular presets nudge their grain read position
  inward and widen its per-grain spray for the same reason. Every factory
  preset across every pack in our library has been verified audible on a
  held note.

- Added an ASSIGN mode to the mod matrix. Turn it on and everything that can
  be part of a modulation route starts glowing blue, both the things you can
  modulate and the matrix rows themselves. Click a glowing control, then
  click a glowing row menu, and that route is made for you. Works for
  sources as well as destinations, and stays on so you can wire up several
  routes in a row. Turn it off with the same button or the Esc key.
- Fixed sample loops that stopped after one pass when the loop end was left
  at the very end of the file.
- Enabled effects now show their tab name in bold and in the brighter text
  colour in the FX section, so you can see at a glance which effects are
  engaged without clicking through each tab.
- The DIST effect has a new Crush type, a bit crusher. DRIVE controls both
  the bit depth and the sample rate reduction together, and TONE and MIX
  work exactly as they do for the other distortion types.
- The ORGANIC CHAOS display now shows the real chaos modulation scrolling
  across in real time, like a seismograph, instead of a static preview curve.
- Switching LATCH off now stops the arpeggio immediately, unless keys are
  still held, in which case it continues on just those.
- RANDOMIZE ALL can no longer land on a silent patch. Every roll is checked
  and gently nudged so a played note always produces sound. The arpeggiator's
  first step of a new chord now always plays, with the chance control only
  affecting the steps after it, so a low chance setting can't roll a
  fully-silent arp pattern.
- Factory presets have been redesigned with several distinct recipes for
  each type (Keys, Texture and Pulse), varying the synthesis engine,
  envelopes, filters, modulation and effects, so packs no longer all sound
  alike browsing through the preset list. Every factory preset now always
  features the pack's own sound in oscillator A, so its waveform is visible
  and audible rather than hidden behind another engine; neighbouring packs
  in the browser get different recipes so adjacent presets don't sound the
  same; and none of them use the arpeggiator. Existing factory presets are
  refreshed automatically the next time your library is scanned; your own
  saved presets are untouched.
- The preset browser no longer covers the synth. It now eases open beside
  the instrument, and closing it restores the original window width. Where
  the host allows it, the window grows to the left so the instrument stays
  put on screen; otherwise it grows to the right, because the host owns the
  window's position there. Hosts that cannot resize the window at all fall
  back to the previous behavior, with the browser overlaying the instrument.
- Wavetable oscillators now have a TABLE menu with built-in tables to choose
  from: Basic Shapes, Supersaw, PWM, Formant, Additive, Unison Spread, Sync
  Sweep and Bells, all morphable with the POSITION knob. Loading your own
  wavetable file still works exactly as before and takes priority over the
  TABLE menu.
- The on-screen keyboard's computer-key playing can now be shifted by octave
  with the Z and X keys, or the new minus and plus buttons on the keyboard
  strip. The setting is saved with your session.
- The REVERB effect has a new engine, based on the classic plate reverb
  design, for a smoother and more natural tail across all five modes (Hall,
  Plate, Chamber, Room, Spring).
- All the effects' MIX knobs, including REVERB, now read in percent, and an
  even 50% now gives an exact half-and-half blend of the dry and processed
  signal instead of the more sensitive curve REVERB used before. Factory
  presets have been refreshed for the new REVERB feel.
- If a preset's sound file can't be found (a moved or renamed library
  folder, an unplugged drive), the strip now says so clearly instead of
  reporting an unrecognized audio format.
- The plugin window now opens at a size that fits the screen it appears on,
  and remembers the size you resize it to.

**Notes for this build**

- The macOS installer is signed and notarized by Apple, so it installs cleanly.
- The Windows installer is unsigned by design. On first launch, click More info
  and then Run anyway to get past the SmartScreen prompt.

## 1.0.14

Three stability fixes, two of them found with a memory checker (AddressSanitizer)
that we have now added to our release checks.

- Fixed a crash when recording in Logic (and other hosts) with a count-in or
  pre-roll while the arpeggiator was on. Before bar 1 the host reports a
  negative song position, and the arpeggiator used it to look up its pattern
  with a negative index. The pattern now wraps correctly from any position, so
  the arp plays the same notes during a count-in that it plays after bar 1.
- Fixed rare, sudden bursts of noise in the reverb tail. When the modulated
  read position of a reverb delay line landed exactly on the buffer boundary,
  a rounding quirk read one sample past the end of the buffer and fed whatever
  happened to be in memory there into the reverb's feedback. Whether you ever
  heard it depended on memory layout, which is why it came and went between
  builds. The same boundary guard is now applied to the delay, the phaser and
  flanger, and the vibrato, which used the same read pattern.
- Hardened the VOICE panel against a project being closed while it is open:
  the panel now cuts its ties to the synth the moment the plugin window goes
  away, so the host's deferred cleanup can never touch a synth that is
  already gone.

## 1.0.13

Two small fixes on top of the 1.0.11 redesign.

- Fixed the VOICE panel's MODE and PRIORITY dropdowns. They could refuse to
  stay open unless you held the mouse down, and selections would not
  register. Both now open and select normally, and closing the panel hands
  control straight back to QWERTY note play.
- Fixed a crash in Logic when the plugin window was closed while the VOICE
  panel was still open. The panel now closes cleanly with the window.

**Notes for this build**

- The macOS installer is signed and notarized by Apple, so it installs cleanly.
- The Windows installer is unsigned by design. On first launch, click More info
  and then Run anyway to get past the SmartScreen prompt.
- Runs on macOS 11 or later (Apple silicon and Intel) as AU, VST3, and
  Standalone, and on Windows 10 or later as VST3 and Standalone.
- The Limiter's optional lookahead mode adds a small amount of latency and
  reports it to your host automatically so playback stays in sync. It's off
  by default, so live play stays at zero added latency until you turn it on.
- Known limitation: on a Mac with a Retina laptop screen plus an external
  monitor, the standalone window may not drag across onto the external display
  (a fixed-aspect window plus mixed-resolution quirk in the window system). It
  works normally as a plugin in your DAW. Workaround: set the external display
  as your main display in System Settings, or use SPASynth as a plugin.

## 1.0.11

A visual redesign of the faceplate, plus a tester-requested feature and two
polish fixes.

- SPASynth has a new look: one continuous dark faceplate instead of separate
  bordered modules, with recessed selector and title bands and softly
  layered shadows between rows. This is a visual pass only, nothing about
  how SPASynth sounds or behaves has changed.
- Sample oscillators now show their loop points right on the waveform
  display. When LOOP is on, the loop region is shaded and its start/end
  points are marked with crisp lines, so you can see exactly where a long
  sample repeats instead of guessing from the knobs. The playback start
  point gets its own subtle marker. Turn LOOP off and the shading/markers
  clear, leaving just the start marker; this doesn't apply to granular mode,
  which already has its own live grain view.
- Fixed a layout bug where a module's tab row (ENV, LFO, FILTER, the FX
  tabs) would condense and re-space itself the first time you clicked a
  tab. Tab rows now lay out the same way from the moment SPASynth opens.
- Fixed a bug where an effect panel's bottom row of knob labels could get
  squashed or clipped on control-heavy tabs like TREM/VIB. Labels now
  always get the room they need; the panel's live display shrinks to make
  room for them if needed.

  as your main display in System Settings, or use SPASynth as a plugin.

## 1.0.10

Fixes and polish from the latest round of tester feedback.

- Playing notes from the computer keyboard no longer stops after clicking
  buttons such as RANDOMIZE ALL, SAVE, the preset arrows, or the panic
  button. A previous fix already covered knobs and dropdowns; every button
  in SPASynth now leaves your QWERTY playing alone. This also covers the
  preset browser (opening the browser itself while the on-screen keyboard is
  showing, picking a preset from the list, changing the pack category, and
  using the KEYS/TEXTURE/PULSE/USER filter chips) and every remaining on/off
  switch and dropdown across the FX sections and filters (for example an
  effect's own ON toggle or character menu) that had been missed by the
  earlier pass. Computer-keyboard playing should now survive any click
  anywhere in SPASynth, including opening the preset browser itself, and
  Esc still closes the browser either way.
- Fixed a library folder bug: picking a folder that held sound files
  directly (with no pack subfolders inside it) was silently rejected, and
  in some cases quietly replaced your chosen folder with the default
  install location, with no explanation shown. SPASynth now accepts a
  plain folder of sound files as a library, and if a folder truly has none,
  it tells you plainly instead of failing silently or discarding your
  choice.
- Controls that don't apply to the current setting are now visibly greyed
  out and can't be touched, instead of looking active but doing nothing.
  For example: an LFO's rate knob while it's synced to tempo (and its
  division menu while it isn't), a sample oscillator's loop range while
  looping is off, the delay's time knob while it's synced to tempo, and
  glide time while glide is off.
- Fixed a short burst of noise on clicking a preset in the browser. It could
  happen if you'd just played and released a note (or the delay/reverb/mod
  tail was still ringing) right before switching patches, since the new
  preset's settings were being applied to that still-active leftover sound.
  Loading a preset now clears that leftover state first, so switching
  patches is always silent unless you're actually playing.
- Added user preset banks. Inside the Save dialog, choose New Folder to
  create a bank in your User presets folder, and it shows up as its own
  category in the preset browser, right alongside your other presets.

  as your main display in System Settings, or use SPASynth as a plugin.

## 1.0.9

A performance and stability pass, wrapping up ahead of launch.

- Bypassing SPASynth in your host now lets reverb, delay, and other effect
  tails ring out naturally instead of cutting them off instantly.
- Lower CPU use for long convolution impulses, and a lighter-weight reverb
  tail engine, with no change to how either sounds.
- The EQ's spectrum analyzer no longer uses CPU while its tab isn't in view.
- General hardening: tightened internal safety margins and a smaller memory
  footprint in a couple of engine components. Nothing here changes how any
  patch sounds.

**Notes for this build**

  as your main display in System Settings, or use SPASynth as a plugin.

## 1.0.8

A small fix for anyone using the on-screen keyboard's QWERTY (computer
keyboard) note input.

- Fixed QWERTY note input stopping after touching a knob or dropdown.
  Previously, playing notes from your computer keyboard would stop working
  the moment you turned any knob or changed any setting, and would only
  resume after clicking directly on a key in the on-screen keyboard. Knobs,
  dropdowns, and toggles no longer take over keyboard focus, so QWERTY play
  keeps working while you tweak the sound.

## 1.0.7

A targeted fix for a serious tester-reported bug, plus extra safety hardening.

- Fixed loud noise bursts in reopened DAW sessions. Reopening a saved session
  could occasionally produce intermittent loud blasts of noise over the
  patch, even while the session sat idle. The cause was a race while the
  session's settings were being restored: the audio engine could briefly run
  on a half-applied mix of old and new settings, and the resulting burst of
  energy then kept re-emerging from the delay's feedback loop. Restoring is
  now properly synchronized with the audio engine, so this cannot happen.
- Effects no longer carry stale energy across an off/on toggle. Switching an
  EQ band or the phaser/flanger off and back on could release a burst of
  sound trapped from before the toggle; those effects now start clean every
  time they are re-enabled.
- New output safety net. As an extra layer of protection, the synth now
  detects and clears any invalid audio state instead of letting it circulate,
  and the final output is capped at a hard ceiling so no malfunction,
  whatever the cause, can produce ear-damaging levels in headphones.

## 1.0.6

A response to tester feedback, focused on levels and safety.

- Reverb levels rebalanced. The reverb's wet signal was running much hotter
  than it should have, which made the MIX knob feel touchy (a little went a
  long way) and let 100 percent mix get loud enough to distort. The wet path
  now sits at a natural level: MIX sweeps smoothly from subtle to full wash,
  and full wet no longer overloads. Factory presets were retuned to match.
  Note: patches you saved with heavy reverb will sound a bit drier than
  before; nudge MIX up to taste.
- RANDOMIZE ALL volume safety. Random patches could occasionally land
  painfully loud, especially in headphones, when several loud settings
  stacked together. Randomize now keeps the combined oscillator level within
  a sensible ceiling (preserving the balance between oscillators, so patches
  stay just as varied in character) and leaves the limiter switched on at
  transparent settings as a safety net. You can switch the limiter off
  afterward if you prefer.

## 1.0.5

A stability and hardening release. We ran a full audit of the code ahead of
launch and fixed every crash, freeze, and reliability issue it turned up;
there are no new features here, just a more solid foundation.

- Fixed a crash when loading a damaged or hand-edited preset file.
- Fixed a possible crash when loading a corrupted WAV file.
- Fixed a rare freeze when a host reports invalid timeline data to the
  arpeggiator.
- Fixed possible crashes when closing the plugin while samples were still
  loading, or while a menu or dialog was open.
- The reported effect tail now includes the Convolve impulse, so bounces and
  freezes no longer cut it short.
- Smoother performance when oversampling is active.

## 1.0.4

Fixes and small improvements from real-world testing feedback.

- Filter 1 now has its own on/off switch, matching Filter 2.
- Reset to Default. A new "Reset to Default" option in the settings menu
  brings every parameter back to its starting point, handy after RANDOMIZE
  ALL or a long tweaking session.
- File browsers now remember the last folder you opened, for both
  sample/wavetable loading and the Convolve impulse browser.
- Fixed the Convolve impulse browser showing valid WAV files as greyed out.
- Tuned the reverb's Decay range so Hall mode no longer produces an overly
  long, uncontrolled-sounding tail at high settings.
- If your library lives on an external drive, reconnecting after unplugging
  it is now much more reliable. Rescan Library offers to point you at a new
  folder instead of silently doing nothing, and sample/wavetable loading
  retries automatically instead of occasionally showing a spurious
  "unrecognized format" error right after a reconnect.

## 1.0.3

A big update to the effects, the voice engine, and sound quality.

**New effects**

- Panic button. If a note ever gets stuck, one click stops all sound and clears
  any held or latched notes. It also responds to your host's panic control.
- Reorderable effects. Drag the effect tabs (there is a grip handle on each one)
  to change the order the effects run in, and the chain order is saved with your
  preset. RANDOMIZE ALL can now shuffle the order too, and the limiter keeps its
  place at the end of the chain.
- Mod tab. A new modulation effect that switches between Phaser and Flanger,
  with rate (free or tempo-synced), depth, feedback, stages, and stereo spread.
- Tremolo / Vibrato tab. Independent tremolo (amplitude) and vibrato (pitch),
  usable together, with shape, rate, depth, and stereo controls.
- Limiter / Maximizer. A loudness stage with drive, ceiling, character modes,
  optional lookahead, and auto-gain, shown on a scrolling gain-reduction meter
  so you can see it work in real time. It sits last in the chain by default.
- Convolve. Use any sound from your library, or your own WAV, as a convolution
  impulse for reverbs, spaces, and creative textures. Browse your library packs
  right from the tab, shape the impulse with pre-delay, decay, and damping, and
  watch it on a live waveform view.
- Reverb algorithms. The reverb now offers Hall, Plate, Chamber, Room, and
  Spring, with pre-delay, size, decay, damping, tail modulation, and tone
  controls.
- Parametric EQ. A new Pro-style EQ with up to 8 bands, draggable nodes (drag
  for frequency and gain, mouse wheel or Cmd/Ctrl-drag for Q, double-click to
  add or remove a band), a live spectrum analyzer, and Clean / Modern / Vintage
  / Tube character modes.

**New voice engine**

- Voice modes. Choose Poly, Mono, Duo, Paraphonic, or Unison from the new VOICE
  button in the top bar, with note priority (Last / High / Low) and unison
  voices, detune, and width.
- Standalone tempo. The standalone app now has its own tempo: set the BPM, tap
  it in, or follow an external MIDI clock, so tempo-synced effects and the
  arpeggiator lock to the right speed without a host.

**Sound quality**

- Oversampling. Run the whole synth at 2x, 4x, or 8x for cleaner, lower-alias
  sound on bright and hard-driven patches. Off by default; choose it from the
  settings menu.

## 1.0.2

**New**

- On-screen keyboard. Click the keyboard icon at the bottom-right of the window
  (or open the settings menu) to show a playable keyboard strip. Play it with
  the mouse or with your computer keyboard (QWERTY), so you can audition sounds
  without a MIDI controller connected. Click the icon again to hide it.
- Settings menu. Click the SPASynth logo in the top-left to open a settings menu
  with Set Library Folder, Rescan Library, Accent Colors, Show Keyboard, and
  Clear All MIDI Learn. It works the same in the plugin and the standalone.

**Fixed**

- The standalone app now launches on macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later. A missing
  build setting made it require a much newer macOS, so it would refuse to open
  on older systems even though the plugins loaded fine.
- Reverb Mix now works as a true dry/wet dial: fully dry at 0 percent, fully wet
  (pure reverb) at 100 percent, with a smooth, even sweep in between. Before, the
  dry signal never fully left and enabling reverb nudged the level up.
- Arpeggiator swing no longer drops notes. With swing turned up, every second
  step could be skipped depending on the audio buffer size.
- The master output meter no longer sits flush against the right edge of the
  window.

**Notes for this build**

- The macOS installer is signed and notarized by Apple, so it installs cleanly.
- The Windows installer is unsigned by design. On first launch, click More info
  and then Run anyway to get past the SmartScreen prompt.
- Runs on macOS 11 or later (Apple silicon and Intel) as AU, VST3, and
  Standalone, and on Windows 10 or later as VST3 and Standalone.
- Known limitation: on a Mac with a Retina laptop screen plus an external
  monitor, the standalone window may not drag across onto the external display
  (a fixed-aspect window plus mixed-resolution quirk in the window system). It
  works normally as a plugin in your DAW. Workaround: set the external display
  as your main display in System Settings, or use SPASynth as a plugin.
